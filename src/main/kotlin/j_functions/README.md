## 10 - FUNCTIONS

**95)** Redo exercise 90, but now in the form of a function called Sum(), which will receive two parameters and will return the sum result between them to the main program.

**96)** Create a program that has a function called Average(), which will receive a student's 2 grades and return their average to the main program.

**97)** Redo exercise 91, but now in the form of a function called Biggest(), but make an adaptation that will receive THREE numbers as parameters and will return which one was the biggest among them.

**98)** Create a program that has a function called SuperAdder(), which will receive two numbers as parameters and then will return the sum of all values ​​in the range between the received values.
*Ex: SuperAdder(1, 6) will add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 and will return 21. SuperAdder(15, 19) will add 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 and will return 85.*

**99)** Make a program that has a function called Power(), which will receive two numeric parameters (base and exponent) and will calculate the exponentiation result.
*Ex: Power(5,2) will calculate 52 = 25.*

**100)** Improve exercise 96 by creating, in addition to the Average() function, another function called Situation(), which will return to the main program whether the student is APPROVED, in RECOVERY, or FAILED. This new function will receive the result returned by the Media() function as a parameter.
