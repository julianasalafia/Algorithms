## 04 - WHILE LOOPS

**38)** Write a program that displays the following count on the screen:
*6 7 8 9 10 11 Finished!*

**39)** Make an algorithm that displays the following count on the screen:
*10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 Finished!*

**40)** Create an application that displays the following count on the screen:
*0 3 6 9 12 15 18 Finished!*

**41)** Develop a program that displays the following count on the screen:
*100 95 90 85 80 ... 0 Finished!*

**42)** Make an algorithm that asks the user for any positive integer and displays a count up to that value:
Ex: Enter a value: 35
*Count: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... 33 34 35 Finished!*

**43)** Develop an algorithm that displays a countdown from 30 to 1, marking the numbers that are divisible by 4, exactly as shown below:
*30 29 [28] 27 26 25 [24] 23 22 21 [20] 19 18 17 [16]...*

**44)** Create an algorithm that reads the initial value of the count, the final value, and the increment, then shows all values in the range:
*Ex: Enter the first value: 3. Enter the last value: 10. Enter the increment: 2. Count: 3 5 7 9 Finished!*

**45)** The above program will have a problem when we enter the first value greater than the last. Solve this problem with code that works in any situation.

**46)** Create a program that calculates and displays the result of the sum between 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + ... + 98 + 100.

**47)** Develop an application that displays the result of the expression 500 + 450 + 400 + 350 + 300 + ... + 50 + 0 on the screen.

**48)** Make a program that reads 7 integers and displays their sum at the end.

**49)** Create a program that reads 6 integers and displays how many of them are even and how many are odd at the end.

**50)** Develop a program that randomly generates 20 numbers between 0 and 10 and displays on the screen:

	a) Which numbers were drawn
	b) How many numbers are above 5
	c) How many numbers are divisible by 3

**51)** Make an application that reads the price of 8 products. At the end, display on the screen what was the highest and lowest price entered.

**52)** Create an algorithm that reads the age of 10 people, displaying at the end:

	a) What is the average age of the group 
	b) How many people are over 18 years old
	c) How many people are under 5 years old
	d) What was the oldest age read

**53)** Make a program that reads the age and gender of 5 people, displaying at the end:

	a) How many men were registered
	b) How many women were registered
	c) The average age of the group
	d) The average age of men
	e) How many women are over 20 years old

**54)** Develop an application that reads the weight and height of 7 people, displaying on the screen:

	a) What was the average height of the group
	b) How many people weigh more than 90Kg
	c) How many people who weigh less than 50Kg are under 1.60m
	d) How many people who are over 1.90m tall weigh more than 100Kg.

**55)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Let's improve the game we made in exercise 32. From now on, the computer will randomly choose a number between 1 and 10 and the player will have 4 attempts to try to guess it.
