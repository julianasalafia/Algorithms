## 02 - BASIC CONDITIONS

**17)** Write a program that asks for a car's speed. If it exceeds 80Km/h, display a 
message saying that the user has been fined. In this case, display the fine amount, 
charging R$5 for each Km above the speed limit.

**18)** Create a program that reads a person's birth year, calculates their age, and 
then shows whether or not they can vote.

**19)** Create an algorithm that reads a student's name and two grades, calculates their 
average and displays it on the screen. Finally, analyze the average and show whether 
or not the student had good performance (if it was above the average of 7.0).

**20)** Develop a program that reads an integer and shows whether it is EVEN or ODD.

**21)** Make an algorithm that reads a specific year and shows whether or not it is 
LEAP year.

**22)** Write a program that reads a guy's birth year and shows his situation in relation 
to military enlistment.
- If it is before 18 years old, show how many years are left until enlistment
- If already after 18 years old, show how many years have passed since enlistment

**23)** In an exclusive promotion for Women's Day, a store wants to give discounts to 
everyone, but especially to women. Create a program that reads the customer's name, 
gender, and purchase value and calculates the discounted price. Knowing that:
- Men receive a 5% discount
- Women receive a 13% discount

**24)** Create an algorithm that asks for the distance a passenger wishes to travel in Km. 
Calculate the ticket price, charging R$0.50 per Km for trips up to 200Km and R$0.45 for 
longer trips.

**25)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Create a program that reads the size of three line segments. Analyze 
their lengths and say if it is possible to form a triangle with these lines. 
Mathematically, for three segments to form a triangle, the length of each side must be 
less than the sum of the other two.
