## 02 - BASIC CONDITIONS

**17)** Write a program that asks for a car's speed. If it exceeds 80Km/h, display a 
message saying that the user has been fined. In this case, display the fine amount, 
charging R$5 for each Km above the speed limit.

**18)** Create a program that reads a person's birth year, calculates their age, and 
then shows whether or not they can vote.

**19)** Create an algorithm that reads a student's name and two grades, calculates their 
average and displays it on the screen. Finally, analyze the average and show whether 
or not the student had good performance (if it was above the average of 7.0).

**20)** Develop a program that reads an integer and shows whether it is EVEN or ODD.

**21)** Make an algorithm that reads a specific year and shows whether or not it is 
LEAP year.

**22)** Write a program that reads a guy's birth year and shows his situation in relation 
to military enlistment.
- If it is before 18 years old, show how many years are left until enlistment
- If already after 18 years old, show how many years have passed since enlistment

**23)** In an exclusive promotion for Women's Day, a store wants to give discounts to 
everyone, but especially to women. Create a program that reads the customer's name, 
gender, and purchase value and calculates the discounted price. Knowing that:
- Men receive a 5% discount
- Women receive a 13% discount

**24)** Create an algorithm that asks for the distance a passenger wishes to travel in Km. 
Calculate the ticket price, charging R$0.50 per Km for trips up to 200Km and R$0.45 for 
longer trips.

**25)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Create a program that reads the size of three line segments. Analyze 
their lengths and say if it is possible to form a triangle with these lines. 
Mathematically, for three segments to form a triangle, the length of each side must be 
less than the sum of the other two.


## 03 - COMPOUND CONDITIONS

**26)** Write an algorithm that reads two integers and compares them, showing on the screen one of the messages below:
  - The first value is greater
  - The second value is greater
  - There is no greater value, they are equal
  
**27)** Create a program that reads two grades of a student and calculates his/her average, showing a message at the end, according to the reached average:
  - Average up to 4.9: FAILED
  - Average between 5.0 and 6.9: RECOVERY
  - Average 7.0 or higher: APPROVED
  
**28)** Make a program that reads the width and length of a rectangular terrain, calculating and showing its area in m². The program should also show the classification of this land, according to the list below:
  - Below 100m² = POPULAR LAND
  - Between 100m² and 500m² = MASTER LAND
  - Above 500m² = VIP LAND
  
**29)** Develop a program that reads the name of an employee, his/her salary, how many years he/she has been working at the company, and show his/her new salary, adjusted according to the following table:
  - Up to 3 years at the company: 3% increase
  - Between 3 and 10 years: 12.5% increase
  - 10 years or more: 20% increase
  
**30)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Redo algorithm 25, adding the feature of showing what type of triangle will be formed:
  - EQUILATERAL: all sides equal
  - ISOSCELES: two sides equal
  - SCALENE: all sides different
  
**31)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game

**32)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Create a game where the computer will draw a number between 1 and 5, and the player will try to guess the drawn value.

**33)** Write a program to approve or deny a bank loan to buy a house. The program will ask for the house value, the buyer's salary, and in how many years he/she will pay. Calculate the monthly payment value, knowing that it cannot exceed 30% of the salary, otherwise the loan will be denied.

**34)** The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a value calculated based on a person's height and weight. According to the BMI value, we can classify the individual within certain ranges.
  - below 18.5: Underweight
  - between 18.5 and 25: Ideal weight
  - between 25 and 30: Overweight
  - between 30 and 40: Obesity
  - above 40: Morbid obesity
*Note: The BMI is calculated by the expression weight/height² (weight divided by the square of the height)*


**35)** A car rental company needs to charge for its services. Renting a popular car costs R$90 per day, and renting a luxury car costs R$150 per day. In addition, the customer pays for the distance traveled in kilometers. Write a program that reads the type of rented car (popular or luxury), the number of rental days, and the distance traveled in kilometers. At the end, show the price to be paid according to the following table:
- Popular cars (R$90 per day)
 - Up to 100Km traveled: R$0.20 per Km
 - Above 100Km traveled: R$0.10 per Km
- Luxury cars (R$150 per day)
 - Up to 200Km traveled: R$0.30 per Km
 - Above 200Km traveled: R$0.25 per Km

**36)** A healthy lifestyle program wants to reward physical activity with points that can be exchanged for money. The system works as follows:
 - Each hour of physical activity in the month is worth points
 - Up to 10 hours of activity in the month: earns 2 points per hour
 - From 10 to 20 hours of activity in the month: earns 5 points per hour
 - Above 20 hours of activity in the month: earns 10 points per hour
 - For every point earned, the customer earns R$0.05 (5 cents)
Write a program that reads how many hours of physical activity a person had in a month, calculates and shows how many points they earned and how much money they were able to earn.

**37)** A company needs to adjust the salaries of its employees, giving them a raise based on some factors. Write a program that reads the employee's current salary, gender, and how many years they have been working for the company. At the end, show their new salary, based on the following table:

| Women | Men	 |
|--|--|
| Less than 15 years in the company: +5% | Less than 20 years in the company: +3%  |
| From 15 to 20 years in the company: +12% | From 20 to 30 years in the company: +13%  |
| More than 20 years in the company: +23% | More than 30 years in the company: +25%  |
